### Low commitment projects (1/5 FTE) in 2023 {-}

Ex 1: Any object can be embedded with an appropriately trained neural network. But can objects be embedded using tree-based models? This project (an ideal candidate for MSc thesis) is about exploring different embedding construction techniques based on random forest or boosting methods.

Ex 2:  Analysis of champion-challenger model pairs on subsets of observations obtained using data segmentation. The project consists of an extension of the EPP method (Elo for predictive models) based on segmented data (e.g. by k-means or by random splits). In addition to the performance analysis, a PD profile comparison analysis is also performed on the splits.

### Mid commitment projects (2-2.5/5 FTE) in 2023 {-}

Ex 1: Development of techniques for explaining segmentation models for 1d (feature-producing models, e.g. survival models), 2d (image-producing models) or 3d data. (CT, hyperspectral images) Experience and knowledge of classical explanatory techniques (SHAP, LRP, CRP) are desirable.

Ex 2:  Development of red-teaming techniques for LLaMA 2-type language models. Development of test suites testing the vulnerability of the model to a set of prompting-based attacks.


### Full-time positions for post-docs in 2023 {-}


In addition to the research tasks listed above, responsibilities include mentoring junior staff (students, PhD students) and leading small research groups.

**Additional information about costs of living in Warsaw**

[From FENS](https://fens.org.pl/en/job-offers/):
Warsaw is the capital of Poland, so in principle it is one of the most expensive cities in the country but living in Warsaw is still much cheaper than in the majority of European cities. In general, a single person in Warsaw is able to cover all necessary expenses (flat, media, transport, food) with ca. 5000-5500 PLN per month. A typical cost of renting a 2-room flat (30-40 square meters) varies between 2000-3000 PLN, depending on the part of the city. Electricity and media (TV, Internet) are usually not included in the rent and have to be paid separately. The cost of the lunch in the vicinity of the main campus of WUT is ca. 25-40 PLN, while a monthly ticket for public transport is 110 or 180 PLN depending on the area of validity. Public health insurance is included in the post (this includes also admission to hospitals), however the medicines are paid separately.

  
  
  
I am looking for a post-doc to join the MI2.AI team for one or two years within [HOMER](https://www.mi2.ai/research-grants.html#homer-2020-2025) project.
The ideal fit is someone with (experience in Medical Image Analysis with deep learning models) OR (someone with experience in AutoML for tabular data).
Experience or interest in **XAI** / **fairness** will always be a huge plus in our team.

We have a young and very energetic team focused on growth in AI. Full time position. Salary above academic average. Little or no didactics. Strong focus on doing things that are **meaningful**.

**Required:**

* PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or similar. (Different background? We encourage cross-domain short research visits).
* Experience in Scientific Programming (R and/or Python and/or C++)
* Good track of Scientific Records

**Scope of work:**

* Automated model exploration
* Interpretable measures for model performance
* Meta/transfer learning in automated model development

### How to write a good motivation letter {-}

If you would like to join our team, it is very important to prepare a good motivation letter. I get dozens of resumes a month and if they look like an automated letter generated with LLM sent to generic recipent I usually don't even write back to them.

We don't do mass recruitment, we recruit 3-4 new people per year and they often work for us for a few years. If you want to work with us then prepare a good cover letter, and especially remember to:

- write clearly what you are applying for. Whether it's a diploma thesis, summer internship, work on a project, which project. Be specific, because if you don't know what you want to do with us, no one will figure it out for you.
- we value in the team people who are able to solve difficult problems. Don't write that you have done 40 projects, but describe the most difficult one you have completed.
- if you have already worked somewhere, write what you did there and what you learned, not just the name of the company or position. 
- before you send a letter review the list of our projects, the list of published articles, maybe talk to people who already work in our team and in your letter write in your own words why you want to work with us and at what

<p><strong>WACV (2025)</strong></p>
We introduce Agg^2Exp, a methodology for aggregating fine-grained voxel attributions of the segmentation model's predictions. Unlike classical explanation methods that primarily focus on the local feature attribution, Agg^2Exp enables a more comprehensive global view on the importance of predicted segments in 3D images. As a concrete use-case, we apply Agg^2Exp to discover knowledge acquired by the Swin UNEt TRansformer model trained on the TotalSegmentator v2 dataset for segmenting anatomical structures in computed tomography medical images.

We explore human factors by conducting user studies in which participants answer general knowledge questions using LLM-generated hints, whereas LLM factors by provoking language models to create manipulative statements. In the long term, we put AI literacy at the forefront, arguing that educating society would minimize the risk of manipulation and its consequences.

We introduce Swin Soft Mixture Transformer (Swin SMT), a novel architecture based on Swin UNETR, which incorporates a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft MoE) to effectively handle complex and diverse long-range dependencies. The use of Soft MoE allows for scaling up model parameters maintaining a balance between computational complexity and segmentation performance in both training and inference modes. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Swin SMT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in 3D anatomical structure segmentation.

We discover that the latent space of Diffusion Autoencoders encodes the inference process of a given classifier in the form of global directions.

Precisely, g-directions allow for flipping the decision of a given classifier on an entire dataset of images, while h-directions further increase the diversity of explanations.

A novel method (SRFAMap) is introduced to map the statistical radiomic feature attributions derived by applying the Integrated Gradients methods, often used in explainable AI, to image saliency maps. In detail, integrated gradients are used to compute radiomic feature attributions of chest X-ray scans for a ResNet-50 convolutional network model trained to distinguish healthy lungs from tuberculosis lesions. These are subsequently mapped to saliency maps over the original scans to facilitate their interpretation for diagnostics.

This paper proposes a new formulation of the tuning problem, called consolidated learning, more suited to practical challenges faced by model developers, in which a large number of predictive models are created on similar datasets. We show that a carefully selected static portfolio of hyperparameter configurations yields good results for anytime optimization, while maintaining the ease of use and implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through an empirical study for the XGBoost algorithm and the newly created metaMIMIC benchmarks of predictive tasks extracted from the MIMIC-IV medical database.

<p>Mustafa Cavus, Przemyslaw Biecek</p>
<p><strong>International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (2022)</strong></p>
The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team and player performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football instead of the score in modern football. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained on 315,430 shots from seven seasons between 2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, we demonstrate a practical application of aggregated profiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal model for monitoring the team and player performance.

<p><strong>Scientific Reports (2022)</strong></p>
In this work, we demonstrate subnetwork detection based on multi-modal node features using a novel Greedy Decision Forest (GDF) with inherent interpretability. The latter will be a crucial factor to retain experts and gain their trust in such algorithms. To demonstrate a concrete application example, we focus on bioinformatics, systems biology and particularly biomedicine, but the presented methodology is applicable in many other domains as well. Our proposed explainable approach can help to uncover disease-causing network modules from multi-omics data to better understand complex diseases such as cancer.

In this paper we introduce WildNLP - a framework for testing model stability in a natural setting where text corruptions such as keyboard errors or misspelling occur. We compare robustness of deep learning models from 4 popular NLP tasks: Q&A, NLI, NER and Sentiment Analysis by testing their performance on aspects introduced in the framework. In particular, we focus on a comparison between recent state-of-the-art text representations and non-contextualized word embeddings. In order to improve robustness, we perform adversarial training on selected aspects and check its transferability to the improvement of models with various corruption types. We find that the high performance of models does not ensure sufficient robustness, although modern embedding techniques help to improve it.

Diffusion models have been the latest revolution in the domain of generative modelling in computer vision, surpassing the capabilities of long-reigning generative adversarial networks , and are currently being adapted to multiple other domains and modalities. However, we still lack an in-depth understanding of their inner workings from both an empirical and theoretical standpoint.

Considering that, the main goals of the DeMeTeR project are:

1. to broaden the practical and theoretical understanding of diffusion-specific latent representations and architecture-specific internal representations of diffusion models,
2. to develop novel methods of manipulating these representations that allow for enhancing safety and explainability of deep learning models

We believe that PINEBERRY will be an important step toward not only “uncovering the magic” behind deep learning algorithms (hence building trust in them in downstream tasks), but also in showing that XAI techniques can be effectively utilized to improve such data-driven algorithms (both classic and deep machine learning-powered), ultimately leading to better algorithms. Finally, we will put special effort into (i) unbiasing the validation of existing and emerging algorithms through ensuring their full reproducibility (both at the algorithm and at the data level), and (ii) ensuring security of algorithms on different levels of data, models, and system.

To this end we develop a catalogue for issues relevant to Security and Explainability that will guide validation of ML/AI models used in SO. This project is conducted in collaboration with KP Labs company.

#### GliomAI: Artificial Intelligence for Radiogenomic Atlas of Gliomas {-}

![](images/mi2-gliomai.png)

The new 2021 WHO classification of brain tumours places more emphasis than before on genetic variation in the classification of tumour lesions. However, invasive procedures are required for genetic diagnosis, which pose risks to patients and limit access to molecular profiling. Radiomics, a non-invasive approach, allows the analysis of tumour features using imaging data such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is used to extract computational independent variables. This approach allows the analysis of heterogeneity, spatial relationships and textural patterns that characterise different tumour phenotypes, however, may not be graspable by human perception. The correlation of such computational variables obtained with genetic findings is called radiogenomics.

Multidimensional datasets play a key role in the development of the field of radiogenomics. However, in order to do so, it is necessary to delineate regions of interest within imaging studies - so-called masks - which are ultimately used to extract computational variables. In this project, we plan to develop a novel radiomic database containing not only clinical, genetic and imaging data, but also the previously mentioned segmentation masks of gliomas and their immediate surroundings. To this end, an interdisciplinary research team will be formed, benefiting from the synergistic impact of the two units involved in the project at our Universities.

Machine learning explainability, fairness, robustness, and security are key elements of trustworthy Artificial
Intelligence, an area of strategic importance. In this context, the main goals of the ARES project are:

1. Develop adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art explanations to investigate vulnerabilities and
limitations of the existing explainability and fairness approaches in machine learning.
2. Introduce novel robust explanations that are stable against manipulation and intuitive to evaluate.

Achieving the first goal primarily impacts various domains of research, which currently use (and explain) black-box models for knowledge discovery and decision-making, by highlighting vulnerabilities and limitations of their explanations. Achieving the second goal impacts more the broad machine learning domain as it aims at improving state-of-the-art by introducing robust explanations toward secure and trustworthy AI.

### DARLING 2022-2024   {-}

#### DARLING: Deep Analysis of Regulations with Language Inference, Network analysis and institutional Grammar  {-}

![](images/project-darling.png)

**Aim of the project**

Developing the tools for automated analysis of content of legal documents leveraging Natural Language Processing, that will help understand the dynamic of change in public policies and variables influencing those changes.

Those tools will be firstly used to analyse the case of development of policy subsystem regulating usage of AI in the European Union.

**Specific goals of the project**

1. Developing and evaluating multilingual models for issue classification for legal and public policy documents.
2. Developing embedding-based topic modeling methods for legal and public policy documents suited for analysis of change of the topics between documents.
3. Institutional grammar based analysis of changes in topics between different public policy documents, regulations and public consultation documents.
4. Agent-based models predicting diffusion of issues in public policy documents.

**Methodology**

The core of the DARLING project is the issues and topic analysis in documents connected with regulations development using NLP tools. Issues analysis shall allow tracking how different options of AI operationalisation, ways the AI-connected threats are perceived as well as ideas regarding AI regulations are shared among three different types of texts: scientific, expert and legal ones. The extracted issues will then be subject to complex networks analysis and institutional grammar approach. The network analysis, backed by agent-based modeling, will be used to examine the flow of issues among the documents based on their vector-formed characteristics. On the other hand, the Institutional Grammar (IG) will be used to analyze the modality of issues, e.g., the tendency to regulate a specific aspect of AI in a given issue, its deontic character or its conditionality.

In result the DARLING project will effect in the development of new methods to analyze legal documents connected to regulation based on deep text processing and links among the documents. An inter-institutional and interdisciplinary team of computer, political sciences and physics of complex systems scientists will elaborate new machine learning approaches to examine the regulation corpora, issues recognition, issues analysis by the means of IG as well as propose new methods of modeling the flow/changes of regulations based on complex networks tools.

[comment]: <> (<img src="images/projects_xlungs.jpg">)

The aim of the project is to support the process of identification of lesions visible on CT and lung x-rays. We intend to achieve this goal by building an information system based on artificial intelligence (AI) that will support the radiologist's work by enriching the images with additional information.

The unique feature of the proposed system is a trustworthy artificial intelligence module that:

- will reduce the image analysis time needed to detect lesions,
- will make the image evaluation process more transparent,
- will provide image and textual explanations indicating the rationale behind the proposed recommendation,
- will be verified for effective collaboration with the radiologist.

### HOMER 2020-2025 {-}

#### HOMER: Human Oriented autoMated machinE leaRning {-}

![](images/project-homer.png)

One of the biggest challenges in the state-of-the-art machine learning is dealing with the complexity of predictive models. Recent techniques like deep neural networks, gradient boosting or random forests create models with thousands or even millions of parameters. This makes decisions generated by these black-box models completely opaque. Model obscurity undermines trust in model decisions, hampers model debugging, blocks model auditability, exposes models to problems with concept drift or data drift.

Recently, there has been a huge progress in the area of model interpretability, which results in the first generation of model explainers, methods for better understanding of factors that drive model decisions. Despite this progress, we are still far from methods that provide deep explanations, confronted with domain knowledge that satisfies our ,,Right to explanation'' as listed in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In this project I am going to significantly advance next generation of explainers for predictive models. This will be a disruptive change in the way how machine learning models are created, deployed, and maintained. Currently to much time is spend on handcrafted models produced in a tedious and laborious try-and-error process. The proposed Human-Oriented Machine Learning will focus on the true bottleneck in development of new algorithms, i.e. on model-human interfaces.

The particular directions I consider are (1) developing an uniform grammar for visual model exploration, (2) establishing a methodology for contrastive explanations that describe similarities and differences among different models, (3) advancing a methodology for non-additive model explanations, (4) creating new human-model interfaces for effective communication between models and humans, (5) introducing new techniques for training of interpretable models based on elastic surrogate black-box models, (6) rising new methods for automated auditing of fairness, biases and performance of predictive models.

#### DeCoviD: Detection of Covid-19 related markers of pulmonary changes using Deep Neural Networks models supported by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Compressed Sensing  {-}

Covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease. A coronavirus infection leaves permanent ramifications in the respiratory system and beyond. In this situation, tools supporting diagnosis and assessment of lung damage after infection and during Covid-19 treatment are crucial. Preliminary results of analysis of CT images and lung xrays suggest that they can help to quickly assess even asymptomatic cases and facilitate prognosis of response to treatment. There are also reports of usefulness of ultrasound images.

The aim of the DeCoviD project is to develop methods and tools to support radiologists in the assessment of lung imaging data for the occurrence of changes caused by Covid-19 disease. The developed solution will allow to automate the identification of pathological changes and will support the diagnosis of coexisting lung diseases as well as diseases of other organs visible on chest images. It will also allow to quantify the severity of lung damage caused by the disease

Responsible decision support for radiologists requires models based on interpretable features. Such features will be stored in a hybrid knowledge base powered by two research teams from WUT, working on the basis of two, seemingly opposite, paradigms of image data analysis. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) team will use trained deep networks to automatically extract features that are essential for effective disease detection. Cognitive Compressed Sensing (CCS) will build a set of interpretable semantic features using sparse cognitive representations agreed with a group of cooperating radiologists. Combining these two approaches will achieve high effectiveness of the constructed models, combined with high transparency, clarity and stability of the solution.

The DeCoviD project is a part of a broader strategy of competence development in the area of deep learning + XAI + medical applications at the Warsaw University of Technology.

### DALEX 2018-2022  {-}

#### DALEX: Descriptive and model Agnostic Local EXplanations {-}

![](images/project-dalex.png)

**Research project objectives.** Black boxes are complex machine learning models, for example deep neural network, an ensemble of trees of high-dimensional regression model. They are commonly used due to they high performance. But how to understand the structure of a black-box, a model in which decision rules are too cryptic for humans? The aim of the project is to create a methodology for such exploration. To address this issue we will develop methods, that: (1) identify key variables that mostly determine a model response, (2) explain a single model response in a compact visual way through local approximations, (3) enrich model diagnostic plots.

**Research project methodology.** This project is divided into three subprojects - local approximations od complex models (called LIVE), explanations of particular model predictions (called EXPLAIN) and conditional explanations (called CONDA).

**Expected impact on the development of science.** Explanations of black boxes have fundamental implications for the field of predictive and statistical modelling. The advent of big data forces imposes usage of black boxes that are easily able to overperform classical methods. But the high performance itself does not imply that the model is appropriate. Thus, especially in applications to personalized medicine or some regulated fields, one should scrutinize decision rules incorporated in the model. New methods and tools for exploration of black-box models are useful for quick identification of problems with the model structure and increase the interpretability of a black-box

### MLGenSig 2017-2021   {-}

#### MLGenSig: Machine Learning Methods for building of Integrated Genetic Signatures  {-}

![](images/project-mlgensig.png)

**Research project objectives.** The main scientific goal of this project is to develop a methodology for integrated genetic signatures based on data from divergent high-throughput techniques used in molecular biology. Integrated signatures base on ensembles of signatures for RNA-seq, DNA-seq, data as well for methylation profiles and protein expression microarrays. The advent of high throughput methods allows to measure dozens of thousands or even millions features on different levels like DNA / RNA / protein. And nowadays in many large scale studies scientists use data from mRNA seq to assess the state of transcriptome, protein microarrays to asses the state of proteome and DNA-seq / bisulfide methylation to assess genome / methylome.

**Research methodology.** Genetic signatures are widely used in different applications, among others: for assessing genes that differentiate cells that are chemo resistant vs. cells that are not, assess the stage of cell pluripotency, define molecular cancer subtypes. For example, in database Molecular Signatures Database v5.0 one can find thousands of gene sets - genetic signatures for various conditions. There are signatures that characterize some cancer cells, pluripotent cells and other groups. But they usually contain relatively small number of genes (around 100), results with them are hard to replicate and they are collection of features that were found significant when independently tested. In most cases signatures are derived from measurements of the same type. Like signatures based of expression of transcripts based on data from microarrays or RNA-seq, or methylation profile or DNA variation. We are proposing a very different approach. First we are going to use machine-learning techniques to create large collections of signatures. Such signatures base on ensembles of small sub-signatures, are more robust and usually have higher precision. Then out of such signatures we are going to develop methodology for meta-signatures, that integrate information from different types of data (transcriptome, proteome, genome). Great examples of such studies are: Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) and The Cancer  Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies. For thousands of patients in different cohorts (for PCBC cohorts based on stemness phenotype, for TCGA based on cancer type) measurements of both mRNA, miRNA, DNA and methylation profiles are available. New, large datasets require new methods that take into account high and dense structure of dependencies between features. The task that we are going to solve is to develop methodology that will create genetic signatures that integrate information from different levels of cell functioning. Then we are going to use data from TCGA and PBCB project to assess the quality of proposed methodology. As a baseline we are going to use following methodologies: DESeq, edgeR (for mRNA), casper (for lternative splicing), MethylKit (for RRBS data) and RPPanalyzer for protein arrays.

Here is the skeleton for our approach: (1) Use ensembles in order to building a genetic signature. The first step would be to use random forests to train a new signature. Ensembles of sub-signtures are build on bootstrap subsamples and they votes if given sample fit given signature or not. (2) In order to improve signatures we are going to consider various normalization of raw counts. We start with log and rank transformation. (3) In order to improve the process of training an ensemble we are going to use pre-filtering of genes. (4) Another approach is to use Bayesian based methods, that may incorporate the expert knowledge, like belief-based gaussian modelling

**Research project impact.** Genetic profiling is more and more important and has number of application starting from basic classification up to personalized medicine in which patients are profiled against different signatures. Existing tools for genetic signatures have many citations. This we assume that the methodology for integrated genetic profiling will be a very useful for many research groups. It is hard to overestimate the impact of better genetic profiling on medicine. Moreover we build a team of people with knowledge in cancer genetic profiling

## Thesis proposals {-}

The MI2.AI team is the place where you can conduct research leading to your bachelor's, master's or PhD thesis. As a general rule (although there are exceptions), engineering theses focus on the development of software, master's theses on the development of a data analysis method, PhD theses on the solution of a larger scientific problem. 

We are currently working red teaming AI models and explainable machine learning. Below are general topics on which you can build an interesting diploma thesis at either Warsaw University of Technology or University of Warsaw.

### Red Teaming AI models {-}

- *Explaining computer vision models with diffusion models*: generative models, and diffusion models in particular, offer impressive capabilities for conditional image manipulation, conditional sampling and allow to incorporate external (not seen during training) objectives into the generative process. One of the ways to advance the state of current methodologies for explaining visual classifiers would be to use diffusion models as a tool to find or synthesize explanations. Many projects with varying levels of detail and advancement are available. For an example paper from this research field, see [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12488) developed in our lab. Feel free to contact us if this topic is of interest to you.

### Explainable machine learning {-}

- **BSc thesis:** *Robustness of global machine learning explanations when features are dependent.* **Goal:** This project aims to directly follow [our recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09069) with theoretical and experimental analysis on how **feature dependence**, i.e. correlation and interactions, impacts the robustness of **global machine learning explanations**, i.e. feature importance and effects, to model and data perturbation. For context, refer to these three papers: [AIj 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2021.103502), [NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07462), [ECML PKDD 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09069). **Effort:** 1-2 people with an interest in statistical learning for tabular data. **Supervision:** Hubert Baniecki (contact me at hbaniecki@gmail.com) & Przemysław Biecek.
